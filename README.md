What is NPS?
NPS stands for net promoter score, and it refers to a standardized satisfaction rate that businesses use to determine how pleased customers are with their business.

Typically, businesses ask clients the following question to rank how customers feel about their companies.

“How likely would you be to recommend (your business) to a friend or colleague?”

This question tends to yield a well-rounded opinion of your business since dissatisfaction will cause customers not to recommend you, while high satisfaction will make them more likely to recommend you.

Those who rate your business zero through six are bucketed as detractors Those who rate you seven or eight are referred to as passives Those who rate you nine or ten are known as promoters
Although businesses use this question to prompt customers, you can take a lot more from your NPS than just how likely customers are to recommend you.

For example, you can get an overall feel for whether you’re running your business in a way that customers enjoy, if your services are effective, or if your products are high-quality.

Although you won’t have detailed insight into these metrics, different scores can prompt you to ask more detailed questions to figure out where you can improve.
